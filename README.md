- 👋 Hi, I’m @FryWolf
- 👀 I’m interested in baking, cooking, doodling, music, crafts, and gaming!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in C# due to wanting a better understanding of code in general.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything other than my own small project with my brother.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Please don't.
